Usage
Application Workflow
Selection Interface

Fruit/Vegetable Selection: Choose your desired crop categorized by season from the first dropdown menu.
Map Type Selection: Select the type of map you want to view:
pH + V√©g√©tation: Displays soil pH levels and vegetation types.
pH + V√©g√©tation + M√©t√©o: Includes meteorological data overlays.
Day Selection: If you choose the meteorological map type, select the specific day to view weather forecasts.
Dynamic Map Display

Based on your selections, the application dynamically loads the corresponding HTML map in the iframe. If the meteorological option is selected, it also displays the number of favorable zones based on weather conditions.

GitHub Actions
The application leverages GitHub Actions to automate daily data processing and map generation.

Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/daily_script.yml and is triggered daily at 3 AM UTC.

Extending the Application
To add new fruits or vegetables to the application:

Update the Dropdown Menu

Modify the <optgroup> sections in index.html to include new crops under the appropriate season.

html
Copier le code
<optgroup label="Nouvelle Saison">
    <option value="nouvelle_culture">Nouvelle Culture</option>
    <!-- Add more options as needed -->
</optgroup>
Generate Corresponding HTML Maps

Update Script_meteo_github.py to handle the new crops by generating ph_veg_<crop>.html and meteorological maps within meteo_rasters/<crop>/.

Run the Script

Execute the Python script manually or wait for the next scheduled GitHub Actions run to generate and upload the new maps.

Security
GitHub Token Management
Revoke Exposed Tokens: If your GitHub token has been exposed publicly, immediately revoke it via GitHub Settings.
Generate a New Token: Create a new Personal Access Token with the necessary permissions (repo scope) and update the repository secrets.
Secure Storage: Store tokens securely using GitHub Secrets and never commit them to the repository.
Best Practices
Limit Token Permissions: Only grant the minimum necessary permissions to your GitHub tokens.
Regularly Rotate Tokens: Periodically update your tokens to minimize security risks.
Monitor Repository Access: Keep track of who has access to your repository and its secrets.
